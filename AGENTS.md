# Hex – Personalized Fork Dev Notes

This is Aliou's personalized fork of [Hex](https://github.com/kitlangton/Hex). Keep fork-specific work on `custom`; the fork repository is `https://github.com/aliou/Hex`.

The app name and Xcode target remain `Hex`, but its identifiers belong to this fork: use `me.aliou.Hex` (and its `.debug` and `Tests` variants). Do not introduce `com.kitlangton.Hex` identifiers or paths.

## Project Overview

Hex is a macOS menu bar application for on‑device voice‑to‑text. It supports Whisper (Core ML via WhisperKit) and Parakeet TDT v3 (Core ML via FluidAudio). Users activate transcription with hotkeys; text can be auto‑pasted into the active app.

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
# Build the app
xcodebuild -scheme Hex -configuration Release

# Run tests (must be run from HexCore directory for unit tests)
cd HexCore && swift test

# Or run all tests via Xcode
xcodebuild test -scheme Hex

# Open in Xcode (recommended for development)
open Hex.xcodeproj

# Build, ad-hoc sign, and install into /Applications
bash scripts/install-local.sh
```

## Architecture

The app uses **The Composable Architecture (TCA)** for state management. Key architectural components:

### Features (TCA Reducers)
- `AppFeature`: Root feature coordinating the app lifecycle
- `TranscriptionFeature`: Core recording and transcription logic
- `SettingsFeature`: User preferences and configuration
- `HistoryFeature`: Transcription history management

### Dependency Clients
- `TranscriptionClient`: WhisperKit integration for ML transcription
- `RecordingClient`: AVAudioRecorder wrapper for audio capture
- `PasteboardClient`: Clipboard operations
- `KeyEventMonitorClient`: Global hotkey monitoring via Sauce framework

### Key Dependencies
- **WhisperKit**: Core ML transcription (tracking main branch)
- **FluidAudio (Parakeet)**: Core ML ASR (multilingual) default model
- **Sauce**: Keyboard event monitoring
- **Swift Composable Architecture**: State management
- **Inject** Hot Reloading for SwiftUI

## Important Implementation Details

1. **Hotkey Recording Modes**: The app supports both press-and-hold and double-tap recording modes, implemented in `HotKeyProcessor.swift`. See `docs/hotkey-semantics.md` for detailed behavior specifications including:
   - **Modifier-only hotkeys** (e.g., Option) use a **0.3s threshold** to prevent accidental triggers from OS shortcuts
   - **Regular hotkeys** (e.g., Cmd+A) use user's `minimumKeyTime` setting (default 0.2s)
   - Mouse clicks and extra modifiers are discarded within threshold, ignored after
   - Only ESC cancels recordings after the threshold

2. **Model Management**: Models are managed by `ModelDownloadFeature`. Curated defaults live in `Hex/Resources/Data/models.json`. The Settings UI shows a compact opinionated list (Parakeet + three Whisper sizes). No dropdowns.

3. **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback is provided via `SoundEffect.swift` using files in `Resources/Audio/`

4. **Window Management**: Uses an `InvisibleWindow` for the transcription indicator overlay

5. **Permissions**: Requires audio input and automation entitlements (see `Hex.entitlements`)

6. **Logging**: All diagnostics should use the unified logging helper `HexLog` (`HexCore/Sources/HexCore/Logging.swift`). Pick an existing category (e.g., `.transcription`, `.recording`, `.settings`) or add a new case so Console predicates stay consistent. Avoid `print` and prefer privacy annotations (`, privacy: .private`) for anything potentially sensitive like transcript text or file paths.

## Models (2025‑11)

- Default: Parakeet TDT v3 (multilingual) via FluidAudio
- Additional curated: Whisper Small (Tiny), Whisper Medium (Base), Whisper Large v3
- Note: Distil‑Whisper is English‑only and not shown by default

### Storage Locations

- WhisperKit models
  - `~/Library/Application Support/me.aliou.Hex/models/argmaxinc/whisperkit-coreml/<model>`
- Parakeet (FluidAudio)
  - We set `XDG_CACHE_HOME` on launch so Parakeet caches under the app container:
  - `~/Library/Containers/me.aliou.Hex/Data/Library/Application Support/FluidAudio/Models/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-coreml`
  - Legacy `~/.cache/fluidaudio/Models/…` is not visible to the sandbox; re‑download or import.

### Progress + Availability

- WhisperKit: native progress
- Parakeet: best‑effort progress by polling the model directory size during download
- Availability detection scans both `Application Support/FluidAudio/Models` and our app cache path

## Building & Running

- macOS 14+, Xcode 15+

### Packages

- WhisperKit: `https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit`
- FluidAudio: `https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio.git` (link `FluidAudio` to Hex target)

### Entitlements (Sandbox)

- `com.apple.security.app-sandbox = true`
- `com.apple.security.network.client = true` (HF downloads)
- `com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write = true` (optional import)
- `com.apple.security.automation.apple-events = true` (media control)

### Cache root (Parakeet)

Set at app launch and logged:

```
XDG_CACHE_HOME = ~/Library/Containers/me.aliou.Hex/Data/Library/Application Support/me.aliou.Hex/cache
```

FluidAudio models reside under `Application Support/FluidAudio/Models`.

## UI

- Settings → Transcription Model shows a compact list with radio selection, accuracy/speed dots, size on right, and trailing menu / download‑check icon.
- Context menu offers Show in Finder / Delete.

## Troubleshooting

- Repeated mic prompts during debug: ensure Debug signing uses "Apple Development" so TCC sticks
- Sandbox network errors (‑1003): add `com.apple.security.network.client = true` (already set)
- Parakeet not detected: ensure it resides under the container path above; downloading from Hex places it correctly.

## Changelog

The in-app changelog lives at `Hex/Resources/changelog.md` and is shown via the About → Show Changelog sheet. Edit it by hand when shipping a user-facing change; there is no longer any changeset/release automation in this fork.

## Git Commit Messages

- Use Conventional Commits for every commit: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, or another standard type.
- Use a concise, descriptive subject line that captures the user-facing impact (roughly 50–70 characters).
- Follow up with as much context as needed in the body. Include the rationale, notable tradeoffs, relevant logs, or reproduction steps—future debugging benefits from having the full story directly in git history.
- Reference any related GitHub issues in the body if the change tracks ongoing work.

## Fork Customization Pull Request

- After each commit to `custom`, push the branch and update draft PR #1 (`custom` → `main`).
- Keep the PR description as the running record of user-facing fork customizations. List feature and behavior changes only, in reverse chronological order, and link each entry to its commit in `https://github.com/aliou/Hex`.
- Do not add maintenance-only changes, including documentation, tooling, CI, or `AGENTS.md` updates, to that list.
